# [Booking app](https://linguini1.github.io/booking-app/)
### Matteo Golin
A basic booking app in react that makes use of the Material UI date and time pickers.

## Notes
This application, due to time constraints, was only designed for mobile view. You can see it in this view using Chrome
devtools.

### Improvements
I had trouble with styling the Material UI components as this was my first time using the library, so there are a few 
things I am unhappy with in the final product:
- The colours of the date/time pickers once they are opened
- The size of the date/time picker selection window when it is opened (for some reason is small on mobile view)
- The outline that still remains on the field boxes in the home view

### Technologies
- React
- Js
- SCSS
- CSS
- HTML
